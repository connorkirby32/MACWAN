##Introduction
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a composition of individual sensor nodes 
delivering information about their environment to a common base station. WSNs come 
in a variety of sizes and functions; however, they all share the desired interest of 
efficient energy consumption at the link layer. Every time a frame is sent from a sensor, 
energy is lost. The amount of energy lost per transmission is determined by the required 
distance the transmission has to travel. Unfortunately, having each node directly 
transmit to the base station could quickly deprive a sensor node of available power if it 
is located a considerable distance away from a sensor.  

##LEACH
There exists many different protocols for creating much more efficient energy 
consumption within a network. This project specifically deals with the Low Energy 
Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol.​

##About the Simulation​
The protocol is simulated using python 
with the matplotlib libraries. Improvements will also be made on the simulated LEACH 
protocol to explore if beneficial optimizations are possible.  
I currently work in the IOT industry. I find the ability to provide real time data over 
a network fascinating, more so when I can see the data happening from a web browser. 
Wireless sensor networks provide the functionality to do that, thus sparking my interest 
in doing the LEACH protocol simulation.
